        "This is an excellent option for a moderately priced hotel in the 5&#47;6 arrondissement. Located close to boulevard St. Michel, Luxembourg gardens and the Pantheon, the location is superb. Rooms are larger than is customary for the area; ours had a walk-in closet that was very useful. Beds were very comfortable, a real plus. Complimentary bottle of water every day was appreciated. Staff spoke English and were very helpful. We found ourselves having breakfast at the hotel a few mornings as it was good; freshly squeezed orange juice made for a refreshing start; espresso machine allows guests to make unlimited cappuccinos etc. I would definitely stay here again.

The hotel staff is very friendly, efficient and helpful. The hotel is very clean , not perfect but pleasingly clean. The breakfast is plentiful, good quality , and a nice assessment to choose from- a tad expensive but it is Paris and American breakfast is hard to find.
